        Yes, c-base will provide space and tables. Space will be allocated based
        on registration information. If you forgot to register as a provider of
        items, it may be possible to get table space if there is room left, but
        people who registered have priority!

        Being a provider of items is free. Depending on the size of the items
        you're bringing, you may be asked for a deposit to cover potential
        disposal costs if you don't take them back home.
      </p>

      <p class="body max-w-4xl">
        However, we highly encourage you to only bring items you're comfortable
        taking back home.

        We have no requirements on how to exchange goods. You can use cash,
        cryptocurrency, PayPal, electronics, services, knowledge, beverages, or
        any other medium of exchangeâ€”it is entirely up to you. Any disputes must
        be resolved between the parties involved. Team members will only
        intervene in cases where c-base rules are breached.
