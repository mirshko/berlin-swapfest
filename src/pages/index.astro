      In association with Berlin's long-time hacker space <a
        href="https://c-base.org">c-base</a
      > we're hosting a quarterly event at their space in Kreuzberg. This is a place
      to swap electronics, computer equipment, and tools.

    <p class="p mb-10">
      In tune with the spirit of right-to-repair as well as re-use; the goal of
      the Berlin Swapfest is for people to bring electronics, equipment, and
      tools they no longer use, but want to bring to a good home. If you've been
      trying to find the perfect equipment to build your home-lab or looking for
      new electronic components or tools, this should be the place for you.
      Berlin Swapfest is inspired by the <a

            Yes, c-base will provide space and tables. Space will be allocated
            based on registration information. If you forgot to register as a
            provider of items, it may be possible to to get table-space if there
            is room left - but people that registered have priority!

            Being a provider of items is free. Depending on the size of the item
            you're bringing you may be asked for a deposit to handle disposal of
            your items should you not bring it back home with you.
          </p>

          <p class="p">
            However, we highly encourage you to only bring items you're
            comfortable bringing back home with you.
