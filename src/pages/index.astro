      In association with Berlin's long-time hacker space <a
        href="https://c-base.org">c-base</a
      > we're hosting a quarterly event at their space in Kreuzberg. This is a place
      to swap electronics, computer equipment, and tools.
    </p>

    <p class="p mb-10">
      In tune with the spirit of right-to-repair as well as re-use; the goal of
      the Berlin Swapfest is for people to bring electronics, equipment, and
      tools they no longer use, but want to bring to a good home. If you've been
      trying to find the perfect equipment to build your home-lab or looking for
      new electronic components or tools, this should be the place for you.
      Berlin Swapfest is inspired by the <a

    <h2 class="faq-header tilt-left mb-5">Do you provide tables?</h2>

    <div class="mb-25">
      <p class="p">
        Yes, c-base will provide space and tables. Space will be allocated based
        on registration information. If you forgot to register as a provider of
        items, it may be possible to to get table-space if there is room left -
        but people that registered have priority!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="faq-header tilt-right mb-5">How much to get a table?</h2>

    <div class="mb-25">
      <p class="p mb-5">
        Being a provider of items is free. Depending on the size of the item
        you're bringing you may be asked for a deposit to handle disposal of
        your items should you not bring it back home with you.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        However, we highly encourage you to only bring items you're comfortable
        bringing back home with you.

    <h2 class="faq-header tilt-left mb-5">How can I swap stuff?</h2>

    <div class="mb-25">
      <p class="p">
        We have no requirements on how to exchange goods; if you choose to use
        Cash, Cryptocurrency, PayPal, Electronics, Services, Knowledge,
        Beverages, etc. it is entirely up to you. Any disputes must be taken up
        with the seller. Only in the case of a breach of c-base rules will a
        team member step in.
